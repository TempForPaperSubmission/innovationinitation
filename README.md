# Innovation Initation Model

## Why a temporary repository?
In this temporary repository, we will share our model two-step model for Innovation Initiation process.
We created this temporary repo because of anylogic's very restricting End User Agreement which applies to all models created with anylogic. Based on this liscense it was not possible for us to share the model in OpenABM Computational Model Library (https://www.comses.net/codebases/) under open-source licenses available in that library. On the other hand, we wanted to follow the rules for anonymouse peer review policy of JASSS. Therefore, we decided to first share this model in this temporary repository and after acceptance, we will move the model to our personal github repos.
